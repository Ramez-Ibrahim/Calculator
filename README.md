# Calculator (React Version)

This is a **responsive** calculator web application built using React. It allows users to perform both basic and advanced arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and a variety of scientific calculations.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear the calculator's display
- Delete the last character entered
- Input decimal numbers
- View the previous and current operands
- Get the computed result using React state
- **Scientific calculator functions**:
  - Parentheses: `()` for grouping operations
  - EE (Exponent)
  - Trigonometric functions: `tan`, `cos`, `sin` and their inverse functions (`tan⁻¹`, `cos⁻¹`, `sin⁻¹`)
  - Exponential and logarithmic functions: `10^x`, `ln`, `log`
  - Factorial: `x!`
  - Euler's number: `e`
  - Square root: `√`
  - Squaring: `x²`
  - Cube: `x³`
  - Pi constant: `π`
  - Reciprocal: `1/x`
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Purpose

This calculator was created to showcase my skills in building a **responsive React application**. It demonstrates my understanding of React components, state management, advanced event handling, and dynamic UI updates. The scientific functions also highlight my ability to implement complex calculations and user interaction flows.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ramez-Ibrahim/calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd src
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Click the number buttons to input digits.
- Click the operation buttons to select the desired operation.
- Use the scientific calculator buttons for advanced calculations:
  - `()` for parentheses
  - `EE` for exponents
  - Trigonometric functions: `tan`, `cos`, `sin` and their inverses (`tan⁻¹`, `cos⁻¹`, `sin⁻¹`)
  - `10^x`, `ln`, `log` for logarithmic and exponential calculations
  - Factorials: `x!`
  - `e` for Euler's number
  - Square root: `√`, squaring: `x²`, cubing: `x³`
  - `π` for Pi constant
  - `1/x` for reciprocals
- Click the "=" button to compute the result.
- Click the "AC" button to clear the calculator's display.
- Click the "DEL" button to delete the last character entered.

## Customization

You can customize the calculator's styling by modifying the `App.css` file. Adjust the colors, sizes, and layout to match your preferences. The calculator is designed to be **responsive**, ensuring that it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
